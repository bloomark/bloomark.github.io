	<h1>Who am I?</h1>

	<p>I'm a Computer Science Master's Student at Cornell University, I'm set to graduate in May '15 *woot*. I'm eager to see where life takes me. I'm going to use this blog to post my rants and occasionally put up some technical content. This website is a work-in-progress, but things ought to get smooth soon.</p>
