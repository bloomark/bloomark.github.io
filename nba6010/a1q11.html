			<h4>11.a.z <b>It is a collection of businesses that operate like a single business through coordination.</b></h4>
			<b>What is a virtual corporation?</b></br>
			The virtual corporation is a temporary network of independent companies--suppliers, customers, even erstwhile rivals--linked by information technology to share skills, costs, and access to one another's markets. It will have neither central office nor organization chart. It will have no hierarchy, no vertical integration.
			</br>
			<h4>11.b.y <b>Specialization reduces their operating costs; they incur higher coordination costs; they can respond to opportunities fast; they lose control over some operations</b></h4>
			<b>What are the advantages and disadvantages of virtual corporations?</br>Advantage</b>
			<ol>
				<li>Fluid and flexible--a group of collaborators can quickly unite to exploit a specific opportunity.</li>
				<li>Can give best possible results- It enables companies to mix and match what it does best with the best of other companies and entrepreneurs to give the best service to customers.</li>
				<li>It's a way to gain scale without mass.</li>
				<li>No legal headaches- Once connected, the companies could sign "electronic contracts" to speed linkups without legal headaches.</li>
				<li>Power and flexibility , robustness and win- win deals</li>
			</ol>
			<b>Disadvantage</b>
			<ol>
				<li>Can lose control of the functions it cedes to its partners.</li>
				<li>Proprietary information or technology may be lost during collaboration.</li>
				<li>The structure can pose stiff new challenges for managers, who must learn to build trust with outsiders and manage beyond their own walls.</li>
				<li>Last but not the least, virtual corporations spells the loss of control over some operations.</li>
			</ol>
			<h4>11.c.w <b>They form consulting teams on the fly from outside the firm, and the teams disband when the project is done.</b></h4>
			<b>Explain how the management consulting firm InterSolve operates as a virtual corporation.</b>
			<p>InterSolve Group Inc. is a Dallas-based management-consulting firm that consists largely of four partners. For any given assignment, InterSolve assembles "just-in-time" talent to solve problems or implement strategies for clients. Once a job is complete, the consulting team disbands. They assemble and disassemble teams for work and  bring the right talent to fit the assignment as opposed to using talent already in inventory. They don't have to warehouse staff or specialists.</br>
			The main advantage of InterSolve is that they get specialists to work on the problems for faster solution and the main challenge is they have to keep their activities coordinated to achieve the best results.</p>
			<h4>11.d <b>We can definitely convert our business into a virtual corporation.</b></h4>
			<p>Big Red Basket currently operates in the Ithaca area, but as it grows into a larger organization whos footprint spans an entire state, coast or even the entire country it will have to start reaching out to other organizations to ensure smooth functioning while reducing the burden on itself. We will have to enlist the services of produce suppliers in other counties and states. It would also make sense for the Big Red Basket to connect with services such as UPS/FedEx to meet fulfillment requirements (current fulfillment in Ithaca just employs students to deliver groceries). Finally, to stitch together multiple supliers and fulfillment providers while ensuring orders don't get lost or misinterpreted it'd be mandatory to have a central IT stack that allows communication between all the corporations involved.</p>
