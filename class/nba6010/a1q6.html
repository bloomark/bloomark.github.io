			Online Education is low quality and is mostly ignored by bigger institutions as unprofitable and inappropriate for their brand name. So these businesses can use them as an entry strategy and expand market share slowly. Since it is mostly free and cheap, it can attract many students all over the world and over time, with improving technology like virtual classrooms, 3D classroom effect, live video and audio discussions with other students, increasing speed of network and easy access to resources & certifications, online education can provide better quality education and would slowly become students preferred choice of education and thus can disrupt the whole education industry. Hence Online Education is a disruptive technology in Education Industry.</p>

			<h4>6.b.w <b>Low quality product is ignored by the competition, and over time as technology improves, it becomes the mainstream product</b></h4>
			<h4>Explain why disruptive technologies are often low quality initially.</h4>
			Disruptive technology refers to technologies which completely displaces an existing market. This happens because they were never thought of as competition by the dominant leaders in those industries and were allowed to grow slowly. Thus most of the disruptive technologies are initially low quality products and hence the dominant players ignore them as unprofitable. And over time, with improving technology they improve their quality and slowly become the mainstream products.
			<h4>Why is low quality an advantage? How do they overcome the quality issue?</h4>
			Low quality is an advantage to these businesses because the dominant leaders tend to ignore them as unprofitable and inappropriate to their brand name. So they do not compete with these businesses and thus these businesses can use them as entry level strategy and survive the big players. They overcome the quality issue over time with the improvement in technology.They use these new technology to provide better quality products.

			<h4>6.c Do you anticipate any disruptive technologies in your business? If yes, how do you expect to counter the threat; if no, why not?</h4>
			<!-- Enter answer here -->
			<p>The main advantage online shopping gives to customers is that there are no travel hours and they need not wait for long hours for billing in physical stores. One of the disruptive technologies which eliminates this wait time is the concept of virtual store via cellphone and virtual shopping inside a physical store where all the shelves are LCD screen and users choose their desired items by scanning the barcode and their groceries are already packed in bags at the checkout.And these virtual stores can be installed on buses, universities and even subways which allow customers to shop whenever they want and their order is delivered instantly. Hence there is no delivery issues and these technologies can pose a threat to our business.</p>
			<p>We are coming up with a mobile App for our business which allows customers to order any time, anywhere and we are also planning to make our company a Virtual corporation which would allow us to instantly coordinate with the closest logistics company and closest grocers to make the delivery instantaneous to customers.</p>
