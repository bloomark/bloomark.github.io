			<h4>What are positive network effects?</h4>
			A product has (positive) network effects if the value of a product to a user increases with the total number of users.</br>Example-Fax Machine – the value of a fax machine is proportional to the number of users.</br>
			<h4>7.b.z <b>Yes, but only if the search engine learns from users and improves the product</b></h4>
			<b>Do search engines on the Web have network effects?</b></br>
			Yes search engines have network effects only if they are learning from customers. This is an indirect network effect. The more the search engines learn, the better would be the product.

			<h4>7.c.w <b>Yes, but only if the search engine learns from users and improves the product</b></h4>

				<li>As the monopolist ages their will to innovate is replaced by mere will to power</li>
