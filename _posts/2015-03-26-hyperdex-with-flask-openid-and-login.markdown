title: HyperDex with Flask-OpenID and Login
category: posts
---

I've started work on building a cryptocurrency exchange with my friend [Akhil](http://akhilum.com), we're using [HyperDex][HD] and Python-Flask to power the project but more on that in a later post. This post is about using Flask-Login, Flask-OpenID and HyperDex. We couldn't find any guides to use OpenID (almost all examples used SQLite) the way we wanted it and I figured a little example could help someone else using this combination of technologies. Akhil was the one that implemented this, but I'm going to steal it all. >:)

This is the HyperDex space that you'll be creating
{% highlight python %}
a.add_space('''
    space users
        key string email
        attributes
            string       name,
            int          phone
        subspace name
        subspace phone
''')
{% endhighlight %}

If your website is going to have users, it needs some way for them to sign up! I've removed the code I used to fetch requested data from the WTForm that is displayed on the HTML Page.
{% highlight python %}
oid = OpenID(app, os.path.join(basedir, 'tmp'))
@app.route('/signup', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
@oid.loginhandler
def signup():
    # Check if a user is already logged in.
    if g.user_email is not None:
        return redirect(url_for('index'))
    signup_form = SignupForm()
    # Validate user's signup form
    if signup_form.validate_on_submit():
        name   = request.form['name']
        openid = request.form['openid']
        # 3.
        session['login_type'] = "SIGNUP"
        session['name_var'] = name
        # 4.
        return oid.try_login(signup_form.openid.data, 
                            ask_for=['nickname', 'email'],
                            ask_for_optional=['fullname'])
    # 5.
    return render_template('signup.html', next=oid.get_next_url(), error=oid.fetch_error(),
                           title='f13x : Sign Up',
                           form=signup_form,
                           providers=app.config['OPENID_PROVIDERS'])
{% endhighlight %}

This is the login function, again, I've removed the code I used to fetch requested data from the WTForm.
{% highlight python %}
@app.route('/login', methods=['POST', 'GET'])
@oid.loginhandler
def login():
    # Check if a user is already logged in
    if g.user_email is not None:
        return redirect(oid.get_next_url())

    # Make a cookie called SIGNUP to pass to handler to let it know that
    # the validate was for SIGNUP and not a regular LOGIN
    session['remember_me'] = login_form.remember_me.data
    session['login_type'] = "LOGIN"
    # Validate the users email
    openid = request.form['openid']
    return oid.try_login(openid, ask_for=['email', 'nickname'],
                                     ask_for_optional=['fullname'])
    # Go back to the login form
    return render_template('login.html', 
                            next=oid.get_next_url(), 
                            error=oid.fetch_error(), 
                            title='f13x : Log In', 
                            providers=app.config['OPENID_PROVIDERS'])

{% endhighlight %}

You've probably noticed that we're storing the user's email address in the session variable. Flask stores encrypted session data in a cookie. Here's how to fetch that piece of information before each request.
{% highlight python %}
@app.before_request
def lookup_current_user():
    g.user_email = None
    if 'openid' in session:
        openid = str(session['openid'])
        if c.count('users', { 'email' : openid}) == 1:
            g.user_email = openid
{% endhighlight %}

The all important logout function
{% highlight python %}
@app.route('/logout')
@login_required
def logout():
    # logout a signed in user. Delete his cookie
    session.pop('openid', None)
    #flash(u'You were signed out')
    return redirect(oid.get_next_url())
{% endhighlight %}

You're definitely wondering by now where HyperDex fits in, well you need to store the user's emailId somewhere!
{% highlight python %}
@oid.after_login
def create_or_login(resp):
    # Check if the login was successful & emailId was provided by the OpenID provider
    if str(resp.email) == None or str(resp.email) == "":
        return redirect(url_for('login'))
    # Check if the user already exists.
    user_exists = False
    if c.count('users', { 'email' : str(resp.email) }) == 1L:
        user_exists = True
    # The user is trying to login
    if session['login_type'] == "LOGIN":
        # If this is an existing user
        if not user_exists:
            return redirect(url_for('signup'))
    # The user is trying to signup
    if session['login_type'] == "SIGNUP":
        # The user already exists, redirect him to the login page, we don't want him signing up again
        if user_exists:
            return redirect(url_for('login'))
        # Sign up was successful, initiate his data!
        c.put('users', str(resp.email), {'name' : str(resp.nickname), 'phone' : 1234567890})
    # Create a cookie with the user's data
    session['openid'] = str(resp.email)
    # Redirect the user to the page he was trying to fetch
    return redirect(request.args.get('next') or url_for('index'))
{% endhighlight %}

Let's say a user wants to update his phone number.
{% highlight python %}
@app.route('/update_phone', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
@login_required
def add_funds():
    if request.method == 'POST':
        new_phone_number = float(request.form['new_phone_number'])
        
        c.atomic_add('users', g.user_email, {'phone' : new_phone_number})
        
        # Redirect the user to the main page
        return redirect(url_for('index'))
{% endhighlight %}

The code might feel a bit out of place, I'll replace it with simpler code snippets if a lot of people don't understand it.
